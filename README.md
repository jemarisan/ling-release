## What is Ling?

Everyone has things they want to do but are afraid to:

- Want to resign, but can't face the boss
- Want to be honest with parents, but fear disappointing them
- Want to confess feelings, but fear rejection
- Want to negotiate a raise, but don't know how to start

**These scenarios share one trait: you only get one shot, and the cost of failure is high.**

Ling gives you **unlimited rehearsals in a virtual world, so you get it right the first time in reality.**

### Core Features

- **LingCard (Persona)** -- Describe someone's personality + your relationship. AI becomes them.
- **LingCard (Script)** -- A rehearsal scenario. Practice until you're confident.
- **AI Friends** -- WeChat-style social interface. Your AI friends remember everything.
- **Behavior Analysis** -- Deep insights into your communication patterns.
- **100% Local-First** -- Chat history stays on your device. AI replies are generated directly by third-party models; we never touch your data.

## Privacy

All chat history is stored 100% locally on your device. Ling has zero backend servers.

Only the minimum context needed for the current conversation is transmitted.
