## What is Ling?

Everyone has things they want to do but are afraid to:

- Want to resign, but can't face the boss
- Want to be honest with parents, but fear disappointing them
- Want to confess feelings, but fear rejection
- Want to negotiate a raise, but don't know how to start

**These scenarios share one trait: you only get one shot, and the cost of failure is high.**

Ling gives you **unlimited rehearsals in a virtual world, so you get it right the first time in reality.**

### Core Features

- **LingCard (Persona)** -- Describe someone's personality + your relationship. AI becomes them.
- **LingCard (Script)** -- A rehearsal scenario. Practice until you're confident.
- **AI Friends** -- WeChat-style social interface. Your AI friends remember everything.
- **Behavior Analysis** -- Deep insights into your communication patterns.
- **100% Local-First** -- Chat history stays on your device. AI replies are generated directly by third-party models; we never touch your data.

## Android Installation

1. Download the `.apk` file from [Releases](https://github.com/jemarisan/ling-release/releases/latest)
2. On your Android device, enable "Install from unknown sources" in Settings > Security
3. Open the downloaded APK and install
4. Once installed, the app checks for updates automatically

## macOS Installation

1. Download the `.dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/jemarisan/ling-release/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG and drag the app to Applications
3. On first launch, right-click the app and select "Open" (to bypass Gatekeeper)
4. The app auto-updates via Sparkle when new versions are available

## Privacy

All chat history is stored 100% locally on your device. Ling has zero backend servers. When using AI features, message text is sent directly to the AI model provider (e.g. DeepSeek, Kimi, and other domestic providers available by default; international providers like Gemini and Claude are only activated when you configure your own API key). We never intercept, store, or relay your data. Only the minimum context needed for the current conversation is transmitted.

## Gitee mirror (China)

For faster access in China, you can run a Gitee mirror of this repo and serve the same download page via Gitee Pages. The page in `docs/` already uses a **Gitee-first** strategy: it requests `https://gitee.com/api/v5/repos/dislab_io/ling-release/releases/latest` first; if that succeeds, download buttons use Gitee asset URLs. If Gitee is unavailable, it falls back to the GitHub API. If your Gitee repo is under a different owner or name, edit the `giteeOwner` and `giteeRepo` variables in `docs/index.html`.

**1. Create and sync the repo on Gitee**

- Create a repo on Gitee named `ling-release` under your namespace (e.g. `jemarisan/ling-release` if you use the same owner).
- Either use Gitee's "Import from GitHub" once, or set up a GitHub Action that pushes this repo (e.g. on push to `main`) to the Gitee repo using a Gitee token (repo scope). The Action can push the branch that GitHub Pages uses (e.g. `main` or `gh-pages`) to the same branch on Gitee.

**2. Enable Gitee Pages**

- In the Gitee repo: Settings > Gitee Pages > Enable, and set the source to the branch and directory that contains the site (e.g. `docs/` on `main`). Save and deploy.

**3. Sync releases to Gitee**

- Gitee does not auto-sync GitHub Releases. When you publish a new release on GitHub (tag + assets), either:
  - Manually create a release with the same tag on Gitee and upload the same APK/DMG, or
  - Use a release script or CI step that, after creating the GitHub release, calls the Gitee API to create a release with the same tag and uploads the same asset files (e.g. `POST /api/v5/repos/:owner/:repo/releases` and asset upload endpoints).

Once the mirror repo and releases are in place, point users in China to your Gitee Pages URL (e.g. `https://your-name.gitee.io/ling-release/`). The page will then use Gitee for both version info and file downloads when available.
